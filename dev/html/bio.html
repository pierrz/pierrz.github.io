<p>After work experience in Sound techniques and Photography,
 I progressively dived into the realm of digital products
 and graduated with a <strong>Master of Information Architecture</strong>
 from the <span><a href="https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/about-us/who-we-are" target="_blank">Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Lyon</a></span> in France
 including an exchange program at the <span><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/about/facts" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a></span>, Canada.
</p>
<br>

<p>I got different titles such as <strong>UX Designer</strong>
 and <strong>Project Manager</strong> until I progressively trained myself
 in <strong>Data engineering</strong> and <strong>Solution architecture</strong> throughout projects
 both in the private and non-profit sectors.
<br>I have had the chance to be involved in a variety of domains and companies such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Digital Humanities at <span><a href="https://europeana.eu" target="_blank">Europeana Foundation</a></li>
    <li>Reporting services for the media industry at <span><a href="https://rtl.nl/" target="_blank">RTL Nederland</a></li>
    <li>Machine-learning applied to Real-estate appraisal at <span><a href="https://geophy.com/evra" target="_blank">Geophy</a></li>
    <li>Data-engineering in a Banking context at <span><a href="https://rabobank.jobs/en/expertise/data-analytics/" target="_blank">Rabobank</a></li>
    <li>App marketplace analytics at <span><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/product/platform/" target="_blank">data.ai</a></li>
    <li>Data-driven system design at <span><a href="https://clearglobal.org/ukraine-language-data-platform/" target="_blank">Clear Global (former Translators without borders)</a></li>
    <li>Aviation data services with an environmental punch at <span><a href="https://www.aerlabs.com/echo-features" target="_blank">Aerlabs</a></li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Besides, I have <strong>designed and developed</strong> the Muzai platform. 
 It is a streamlined <strong>data platform</strong> embedded with <strong>Computer vision features</strong>,
 dedicated to enhance digitized art collections with <strong>Linked Data and IIIF</strong> standards.
 I presented this project at the
 <span><a href="https://iiif.io/event/2019/goettingen/program/78/" target="_blank">2019 IIIF Conference</a></span> in Göttingen, Germany.
 It is available at <span><a href="https://muzai.io" target="_blank">muzai.io</a></span>.
</p>

<p>I currently work at the <span><a href="https://wfp.com" target="_blank">World Food Program</a></span> in Rome, Italy as a Consultant software engineer,
 focusing on the data pipelines which support the <strong>food security monitoring infrastructure</strong>. 
 Part of this work can be seen through the
 <span><a href="https://hungermap.wfp.org/" target="_blank">HungerMap</a></span> product,
 a live dashboard focused on the situation of 30+ countries.
</p>
<br>

<p>Through my career, I have eventually lead small teams composed of designers and developers,
 and I am now looking to take on managerial positions such as <strong>Product Manager</strong>
 and apply my holistic approach and coordination skills further into the development of data-driven products.
</p>

<p>Guided by my initial training in Information Architecture
 I tend to follow <strong>design principles</strong>, 
 while taking great care of gathering and considering every technical aspects
 based on my experience with <strong>Agile/SCRUM techniques</strong>.
<br>My drive is to <strong>define and structure with all due respect</strong> the work at hand.
 It ensures that both time and resources are allocated wisely, and with each component delivery,
 builds up development momentum and brings more opportunities for new features.
</p>
<br>

<p>I genuinely believe that <strong>team spirit and consistent coordination</strong> are necessary
 to <code>walk&nbsp;the&nbsp;walk</code> and deliver great digital products 
 supported by <strong>sound engineering and smooth user-experience</strong>.
