<p>After work experience in Sound techniques and Photography,
I progressively dived into the realm of digital products
and graduated with a <strong>Master of Information Architecture</strong>
from the <span><a href="https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/" target="_blank">Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Lyon</a></span> in France.</p>

<p>I got different titles such as <strong>UX Designer</strong>
and <strong>Project Manager</strong> until I progressively trained myself
in <strong>Data engineering</strong> and <strong>Solution architecture</strong> throughout projects
both in the private and non-profit sectors.
<br>I am now looking to take on positions with more responsibilities
    such as <strong>Product Manager</strong>.
</p>

<p>I have had the chance to be involved in a variety of domains such as
<strong>digital asset management, video on demand, digital humanities, banking,
real estate, digital marketplace, aviation and food security monitoring.</strong></p>

<p>Guided by my initial training in Information Architecture
and my work experience with <strong>Agile/SCRUM techniques</strong>,
I tend to follow <strong>design principles</strong> while taking great care of 
gathering and considering every technical aspects with all due respect.
<br>My drive is to properly <strong>define and structure</strong> the work at hand 
and eventually build up momentum as each component gets delivered, 
both to save time/resources and to use it as a stepping-stone for further developments,
whichever it could be.</p>

<p>I currently work at the <strong>World Food Program</strong> in Rome as a Software engineer,
refactoring the data pipelines which support the data collection
related to food security monitoring. Part of this work can be seen
through the <span><a href="https://hungermap.wfp.org/" target="_blank">HungerMap</a></span> product, a live dashboard focused on the situation of 30+ countries.</p>

<p>Besides, I have <strong>designed and developed</strong> a streamlined, data-driven <strong>platform</strong> for cultural institutions to improve their collections with Linked Data and IIIF standards, and embedded with Computer vision features. I presented this project at the 2019 IIIF Conference in Göttingen, Germany.
