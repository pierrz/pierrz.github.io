# Portfolio
Just the repository for my personal portfolio, set up as a Github page. Fancy enough.

## To-Do

- LFS for oldies/originals
- Minifying
- Pitch final touch

## Debt
- Modernizr (with html5shiv) and jQuery update
- Desktop touch and/or minimum resolution to enable the grid

## History
- 2024-02-02: moved from `master` branch to `main`
